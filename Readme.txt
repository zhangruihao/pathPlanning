The DATA'S INTRODUCTION:

For all test problems, 'Map' is the matrix that represents the map, (START_x, START_y) is the coordinate of the 'START',  and (GOAL_x, GOAL_y) is the coordinate of the 'GOAL'.

For the first to fifth test problems: 'Red_areas' is the coordinate of the red areas. Each of its rows represents a coordinate, the first column is the x-coordinate and the second column is the y-coordinate.

For the sixth to tenth test problems: 'F' is the coordinate of the passable areas and related the optimized targets' values. Each of its rows represents a passable area's coordinate and related the optimized targets' values. The first column is the x-coordinate, the second column is the y-coordinate, the third column is F1's value, the fourth column is F2's value, ...

For the eleventh to twelfth test problems: 'Yellow_areas' is the coordinate of the yellow areas. Each of its rows represents a coordinate, the first column is the x-coordinate and the second column is the y-coordinate.
